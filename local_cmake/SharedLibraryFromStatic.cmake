# shared_library_from_static([library name] REQUIRES [bunch of stuff] [DIRECT])
# 
# This is performed in 2 stages.
# Stage 1 collects the set of archives by building a dummy executable in them
# but intercepting the link stage to find the set of archives.
#
# Stage 2 builds the actual shared library. It merges the archives listed
# by stage 1 and uses that to put together the shared library 
#
# Stage 1:
# .1 What we do first is to identify all the archive files. That is done by
#   creating an executable. essentiallly generating make_executable(REQUIRES
#   [bunch of stuff]) using a dummy cpp file.  
# 2. We then intercept the link stage using (RULE_LAUNCH_LINK)
#    redirecting it to a shell script called dump_library_list.sh
# 3. dump_library_list (aside from completing the link), also generates 2
# files. 
#     collect_archives.txt --> contains all libraries which live inside the
#                               build directory 
#     collect_libs.txt --> contains all libraries which live elsewhere.
#
#  Stage 2:
#  1. The 2nd stage, does the same thing, create a dummy file, and generates
#      make_library(REQUIRES [bunch of stuff])
#  2.  And then once again, intercepts the link stage redirecting it to a
#      shell script called collect_archive.sh
#  3. This script will then:
#     - unpack all the archives in collect_archives.txt, merging them into 
#       a single library called collect.a
#     - appends the contents of collect_libs.txt 
#     - combine it with the original shared library link line
#       as well as instructing the linker to take the complete contents
#       of collect.a (ex: -Wl,-whole-archive collect.a -Wl,-no-whole-archive)
#     -  complete the link 
#
# If DIRECT is set, only direct dependencies in REQUIRES collected. Recursive
# dependencies are not collected.
